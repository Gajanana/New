        "\n",
        "The Monty Hall problem arose from the gameshow <i>Let's Make a Deal</i>, where a guest had to choose which one of three doors had a prize behind it. The twist was that after the guest chose, the host, originally Monty Hall, would then open one of the doors the guest did not pick that also did not have the prize behind it. Afterwards, Monty would ask if the guest wanted to switch which door they had picked. Initial inspection may lead you to believe that if there are only two doors left there is a 50-50 chance of you picking the right one, and so there is no advantage one way or the other. However, it has been proven both through simulations and analytically that there is in fact a 66% chance of getting the prize if the guest switches their door after Monty opens one, regardless of the door they initially went with."
